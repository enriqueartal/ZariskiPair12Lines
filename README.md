# ZariskiPair12Lines
Sagemath code for the computation of the truncated Alexander invariant of Galois-conjugated line arrangements which allow to prove that their fundamental groups are not isomorphic.

This repository contais the Sagemath code for the problem stated in the above lines. It contains two files:
	CodeLines.sws: Notebook file with the code
	CodeLines.txt: text file to be used in a personal installation of Sagemath or in CloudSagemath
